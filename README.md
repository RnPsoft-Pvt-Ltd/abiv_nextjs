[Mermaid ERD](https://www.mermaidchart.com/raw/2b886511-0556-411a-a197-006a0187ede2?theme=light&version=v0.1&format=svg)

## **App Overview and Objectives**
The goal of this web app is to assist **teachers**, **colleges**, and **universities** by automating and digitizing repetitive tasks, reducing teacher workload, and providing insightful data on **attendance**, **performance**, and **educational quality**. The platform uses **AI** and **digital logging** to streamline processes such as attendance tracking, paper checking, and generating educational content, enabling educators to focus more on teaching and less on administrative duties.

## **Target Audience**
- **Primary:** Teachers, Department Heads, Super Admins (Principals/Deans)
- **Secondary:** Educational institutions (schools, colleges, universities) that want to automate attendance, grading, and performance analysis.
- **Tertiary:** Students (via AI-generated explanatory videos for lessons)

## **Core Features and Functionality**
1. **Digital Attendance Management**
   - Manual attendance tracking by teachers.
   - Automatic attendance report generation with insights like percentage trends, low attendance warnings.
   - Customizable attendance criteria set by the super admin (minimum attendance requirements).
   
2. **AI-Generated Question Papers**
   - Teachers can either use pre-trained **NLP models** to generate MCQs, long-answer questions, and test series or upload their own questions.
   
3. **AI-Assisted Paper Checking**
   - Teachers upload answer sheets (digital or scanned).
   - AI compares the answers to the provided marking scheme, automatically grading the papers.
   - AI-generated PDF results sent to students for transparency. Students can report discrepancies to the HOD.

4. **AI-Generated Teaching Videos**
   - Teachers upload notes, and the platform generates full-length AI-driven teaching videos with a deep fake teacher and corresponding visuals.
   - Videos are accessible for students to rewatch as supplementary material.
   
5. **Performance Metrics for Teachers**
   - Performance scoring based on the generated test results.
   - Insights and metrics provided to department heads and super admins to evaluate teaching quality and performance.

6. **Role-based Access**
   - **Super Admin** (Principal/Dean/Director) has overall control.
   - **Department Heads** can oversee teachers, approve/review attendance and performance reports, and assign teachers to classes.
   - **Teachers** can manage their own attendance and grading.

7. **Customizable Subscription Model**
   - Subscription-based B2B pricing (per institution).
   - Pricing tiers based on the number of **teachers**, **students**, and enabled **features**.
   - Ability to purchase features individually or as part of a package (small, medium, or large scale).

## **High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations**
1. **Frontend**
   - **Next.js** for SSR/SSG (Server-Side Rendering/Static Site Generation), to improve SEO, performance, and scalability.
   - **React** for building dynamic, component-based UIs.
   - **TailwindCSS** or **Styled Components** for UI styling.
   
2. **Backend**
   - **Node.js** for RESTful APIs to handle user management, AI integrations, and report generation.
   - **Middleware** for authentication, real-time data, and (NeonDB)PostgreSQL database management.
   - **Redis** for session management, caching, background job queues, and real-time updates.
   - Prisma ORM
   
3. **AI/ML Integration**
   - Utilize pre-trained **NLP models** (for question paper generation and paper checking).
   - AI-driven video generation and **deep fake** technology for teaching video creation.
   
4. **Database**
   - **PostgreSQL** (via NeonDB) to manage user data, attendance records, question banks, and reports.
   - **Redis** for caching and real-time data storage.
   
5. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - **AWS** or **Google Cloud Platform** for server hosting, video processing, and scalable storage.
   - **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** for storing large video files and user uploads (e.g., scanned papers, notes).

## **Conceptual Data Model**
1. **Users Table**
   - `id`, `name`, `role`, `institution_id`, `email`, `password`, etc.
   
2. **Attendance Table**
   - `id`, `student_id`, `teacher_id`, `date`, `status (present/absent)`, etc.
   
3. **Performance Table**
   - `id`, `student_id`, `subject_id`, `test_type`, `score`, etc.
   
4. **Question Papers Table**
   - `id`, `teacher_id`, `subject_id`, `question_type`, `questions`, `created_at`, etc.
   
5. **Reports Table**
   - `id`, `teacher_id`, `subject_id`, `attendance_percentage`, `performance_score`, etc.

## **User Interface Design Principles**
1. **Intuitive Navigation**  
   - Simple, clean UI for teachers and admins to navigate easily through attendance, performance reports, and generated content.
   
2. **Real-time Updates**  
   - Updates should be displayed instantaneously, particularly for attendance and performance metrics (using WebSockets or Redis pub/sub).
   
3. **AI Integration Visibility**  
   - Users should have clear access to AI-generated content (question papers, graded papers, videos), and be able to provide feedback or flag errors.

4. **Mobile-Friendly Design**  
   - Since teachers and admins may access the portal on various devices, a responsive design is crucial.

## **Security Considerations**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure that users only access data relevant to their role.
- **End-to-End Encryption** for sensitive student data, including performance scores and personal information.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for super admins and department heads.
- **Rate Limiting** via Redis to prevent abuse (e.g., frequent requests for AI-generated content).

## **Development Phases or Milestones**
### **Phase 1: Core Functionality**
- User registration, roles, and authentication.
- Attendance system implementation (manual attendance and report generation).
- Basic AI-powered question paper generation and paper checking features.
- Super admin dashboard for performance and attendance tracking.
  
### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- AI-generated teaching videos (note uploads â†’ video creation).
- Department head and teacher dashboards.
- Advanced AI paper checking with report flagging.
  
### **Phase 3: Optimization and Scaling**
- Redis integration for session management and caching.
- Performance optimization (AI model fine-tuning, Redis caching, etc.).
- Customizable subscription model and feature-based pricing.
  
### **Phase 4: Testing, QA, and Launch**
- Final bug fixing, load testing, and security audits.
- User feedback collection from beta testers.
- Finalize documentation and deploy to production.

## **Potential Challenges and Solutions**
1. **AI Accuracy Issues**  
   - Solution: Provide a manual override option for teachers to adjust AI-generated results.
   
2. **High Computational Load (AI processing)**  
   - Solution: Offload AI tasks to background jobs (e.g., using Redis queues) and cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda for scalable compute power).

3. **User Adoption**  
   - Solution: Provide detailed guides, tutorials, and support to ensure teachers feel comfortable with the platform.

## **Future Expansion Possibilities**
- **Advanced Analytics:** Add more complex data analysis tools, such as trend forecasting for student performance.
- **Mobile App:** Develop mobile versions of the platform for teachers and admins.
- **Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS):** Integrate with existing LMS like Moodle or Google Classroom for seamless data exchange.
